# DodgeIt
Dodge It is a simple game that lets you control a ball using the accelerometer sensor in your mobile device. The objective of the game is to navigate the ball through a series of obstacles and keep on going as long as you can to get a higher score.

This project will make use of the gyroscope sensor of our phone to control the navigation of the ball to make it pass through obstacles, which will come in a loop randomly placed across the screen of our phone. We will also add the functionality to direct the ball using onTouchListener() so that we can use it to navigate by touching the ball.

A gyroscope sensor is a device that measures and detects changes in orientation and angular velocity of an object. It is used to determine the direction and magnitude of rotational motion.
A gyroscope sensor consists of a spinning rotor, which is mounted on a set of gimbals, and a set of sensors that measure the changes in the orientation of the rotor. When the device is rotated, the rotor moves in response to the rotation, and the sensors detect the changes in the orientation and the speed of the rotor.
